## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to **Crescence of Wizardry**, an <b>original<b> project I crafted as a secondary school student obsessed with computer vision and the magic of coding. Inspired by the Harry Potter universe, this application uses real-time hand tracking, pattern matching, and Arduino integration to simulate wizardry‚Äîthink casting spells with gestures or wielding an invisibility cloak. It‚Äôs a showcase of my ability to fuse creativity with advanced tech, from machine learning to hardware interfacing, all while delivering an enchanting user experience. It is layered with a modern Graphical User Interface (GUI) that encompasses a variety of features included in the customtkinter library.

### Key Features
- **Invisibility Cloak**: Turn invisible using a green screen and computer vision.
- **Spell Casting**: Recognize hand gestures as "spells" with ML pattern matching, triggering interactive outputs.
- **Wand Interaction**: Use a physical "wand" (Arduino-powered) to enhance the magical experience.
- **Real-Time Magic**: Seamless webcam-based interaction for an immersive wizardry vibe while being tested with a quiz in the Sorting Hat section.
